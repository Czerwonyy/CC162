0-15 = Data/Address bits
15-28 = OPCODE bits

Data/Address bus OPCODES

ALU OPCODE 

	Register select are located in first 4 bits (0-3 bit)

Default (Last 8 data bits = 0)
...0000 (In Assembly) Is A, A

Bits from 0-3 are responsible for chosing 2nd register
...0001 is A, B
...0010 is A, C
...0011 is A,D

Bits from 3-7 are responsible for chosing 1st register
...0100 is B, A
...1000 is C, A
...1100 is D, A

   54	Negative ALU inpits are located in bits 4 and 5

...00... doesn't negate 	(For example A, A)
...01... negates input 1	(For example -A, A)
...10... negates input 2	(For example A, -A)
...11... negates both inputs	(For example -A, -A)

	Bits 6 and 7 are not used

   98	Bits 8 and 9 change operation in AU and LU

...00... is Addition or AND gate
...01... is Subtraction or OR gate
...10... is Multiplication or XOR gate
...11... only devides (Logic output will = input 2)

	Bit 10 will change output form AU to LU (AU is default output)

OPCODE outside of ALU

	Bit 11 writes data from ALU to output register (OUT_REG)

	Bit 12 Resets OUT_REG

	Bits from 13-15 are not used

OPCODES that dont use Data/Address bus (bit 15-27)

	Bits 16-19 write data from Data/Address bus to register from A to D

Bit 16 - reg A
Bit 17 - reg B
Bit 18 - reg C
Bit 19 - reg D

	Bits 20-23 resets value inside registers from A to D

Bit 20 - reg A
Bit 21 - reg B
Bit 22 - reg C
Bit 23 - reg D

	Bit 24 writes data from data/address bus into RAM

	Bit 25 outputs data from  RAM into data/address bus

	Bit 26 writes addres from data/address bus to RAR (Ram address register)

	Don't use bit 27 for now (it't jump command that can cause infinite loop in your program, for now it's unpluged to not cause any harm)

	Bit 28 goes to first step of a program (address 0), it can also be done from control panel by switching switch nr.1
